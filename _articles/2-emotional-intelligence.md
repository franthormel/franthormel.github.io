It has always been taught to us that IQ is what guides our destiny and it cannot be changed through experiences. However, have you experienced situations wherein people of moderate IQ fair better against life's challenges compared to those with a superior aptitude?

The author of the book presented the idea of **emotional intelligence** which composes: **self control, zeal, persistence and self-motivation.**



## Emotion's Purpose
For moments in our existence, we have been swept with uncontrollable emotions that seem to be knee-jerk reactions to situations that we deem to be of threat to us. Parents are willing to sacrifice themselves in exchange for their child's survivability,  anger is produced when a hostile encounter is created, or an expression cold as ice is felt when an  embarrasing moment occurs.

For most, they would argue that such situations could only be remedied with intellect alone, however, there was a time in our pre-history wherein intellect did not at least come into full fruition. Our ancestors had to rely on quick reactions to hostilities and dangerous environments to protect themselves and their families from danger and ensure the species' continuity.

The incontrollable emotions we therefore ocassionaly exhibit can be attributed to our own survival instincts but the days of ferocious wild animals have been drastically rare and have been replaced by unfriendly, rude, and sometimes downright hostile groups of people.



## Emotional intelligence nature
Individuals even with high IQ can be poor navigators in the sea of life and at best IQ only contributest to 20 percent of life's success leaving a spacious 80 percent for other forces.

Current academic qualities can only prepare ourselves for the challenges that await us with lesser to no effect. Emotional intelligence offers a new window of meta-cognition which aides us in determining in making do of what we are endowed with and the raw intellect that we possess.

Individuals that are emotionally capable can be well-tempered and can marshall control over their inner battles, effectively deal and read other people's feelings and it can also serve as an advantage in life's domain.

There are two (2) types of personal intelligence: ***Inter*personal** intelligence is the ability in understanding other people and ***Intra*personal** intelligence, a capacity to form an accurate and realistic model of oneself and use that model to operate effectively in life.

Majority of people who will describe an intelligent person is someone who possess practical people skills like the following:
1.  **Knowing one's emotions**: *Self-awareness* is the cornerstone of emotional intelligence, being fully aware of the emotion, one is currently experiencing and being able to monitor such emotion.
2.  **Managing emotions**: How to handle feelings of oneself so that they can be appropriate.
3.  **Motivating oneself**: Being able to create emotions in the service of a goal.
4.  **Recognizing emotion in others**: *Empathy*, *altruism*, or *people skill*. More attuned to the subtle social signals that signify other people's needs or wants.
5.  **Handling relationships**: The art of relations in the larger scope is a skill in managing emotions in others.

## Empathy
> Empathy builds on self-awareness; the more open we are to our own emotions, the more skill we will be in reading feelings.

This ability to conceive other feelings assists in various domains in life and its absence is apparent in violent criminals.

Conveyance of emotions are passed usually through nonverbal ways (about 90 percent): voice tones, gestures, facial expressions, etc.

The term used before ws **motor mimicry** and in the 1920s the word **empathy** was coined by E. B. Titchener. Titchener's theory suggest that **empathy comes from a physical imitation of the distress of another** and another distinct term **sympathy, is the general plight for another with no sharing of whatever that person is feeling.**

This feeling stems from around two-and-a-half year old toddlers wherein they can distinguish other's existence and they too realize others' distress which is different from theirs.

> A neighbor's baby cries . . . and Jenny approaches and tries to give him some cookies. She follows him around and begins to whimper to herself. She then tries to stroke his hair, but he pulls away. . . . He calms down, but Jenny still looks worried. She continues to bring him toys and to pat his head and shoulders.

Another's trouble is also our own, to feel with another is to care for. In this sense, we can make that the *origin of morality is found in empathy*. The more empathic people are, the more they favor the moral principle that resources should be allocated according to people's need.

## Fundamentals of the emotionally intelligent
It is to be emphasized that we always have choices about how we respond to emotion, and the more we know on ways to respond to an emotion, the richer our lives can be.

**Self-awareness** is a core fundamental, recognizing one's feelings, building a thorough definition for them, recognizing the connections with one's thoughts, feelings and reactions, knowing if such thoughts and feelings are ruling our decisions, foreseeing the consequences of alternatives, and applying such insights to critical decisions and issues.

**Emotional management**, how to handle anxieties, sadess and rage and being able to control impulses. There is also importance in responsibilities for decisions, actions and commitments.

A key ability is also **empathy**, understanding others, their feelings, their perspectives and respecting people's differences regarding certain matters.

Other competencies are also important and many of them are in the form of interpersonal skills suchs as: reading social and emotional cues, active listening, capability to resist negative influences, and performing appropriately in a given situation.
