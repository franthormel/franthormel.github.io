    <p class="about__body">
      I have been focusing on strengthening my skills to improve my work. That
      involves web development, mobile applications, design, and user
      experience.
    </p>
    <p class="about__body">
      My education primarily is in information technology therefore I have
      experience in networking and databases. I have recently picked up user
      interface and design in 2021 after I visited Dribbble.
    </p>
    <p class="about__body">
      I have also been reading new things and any other fields that I deem
      interesting. I hope there is a chance you and I can exchange our thoughts
      and ideas.
